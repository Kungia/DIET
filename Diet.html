            <h2>What does a wolf eat? </h2>
    <p> Wolves are carnivores, and their diet consists primarily of ungulates (hoofed mammals) such as deer, moose and wild boar.
         These large animals are supplemented with a number of small animals, such as beavers, rabbits, rodents, birds, reptiles, and even insects. </p>

    <h2>How often does the wolf eat?</h2>
    <p>A wolf can survive up to a few weeks without eating but to thrive it needs to eat every day. </p>    
    <hr>

    <h2></h2> How much does a wolf eat?</h2>
    <p>A wolf can survive on just over a kilo of food per day but they require the triple amount to thrive and reproduce.</p>
